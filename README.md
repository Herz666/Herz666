🧠 About Me

    🔬 I’m currently working on high-energy physics, focusing on both experimental setups and theoretical models related to fundamental particles and interactions.

    🌱 I’m actively learning quantum computing and artificial intelligence, aiming to apply them to challenging problems in modern physics.

    🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on developing intelligent algorithms and quantum models, particularly in applications across science, data analysis, and complex systems.

    🤔 I’m looking for help with integrating quantum algorithms into physics simulations and applying deep learning to real experimental data.

    💬 Ask me about:  hybrid quantum-classical models, data-driven physics, or anything at the frontier of AI and physics.
